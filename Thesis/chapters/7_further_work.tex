\chapter{Further Work}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is hard to predict what any further work maybe at this stage but some possible suggestions will include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Modelling uncertainty in the robot's movements.
\item Developing an advanced graphical user interface.
\item Improving the robot's pose estimate using SLAM.
\item Accommodating more sensor models than just LIDAR.
\end{itemize}
