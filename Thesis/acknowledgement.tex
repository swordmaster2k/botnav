I would like to take this opportunity to thank the following people in no particular order: my excellent supervisor Arnold Hensman for guiding me throughout the course of this project and helping it reach a successful conclusion. Dr Markus Hoffman for proposing the interesting idea of computing a path from every possible free cell in an environment which exponentially increased the quality of our data. Tucker Balch, who's intuitive tutorial on grid-based navigation helped kick-start this project over the summer months. Sven Koenig the author of several path planning algorithms for taking the time to respond to my queries. Finally I would like to thank my family and friends for their continual support.
