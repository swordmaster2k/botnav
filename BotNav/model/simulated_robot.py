'''
A generic Robot class which (may) represent(s) a hardware robot that 
implements the communications interface defined by the robonav tool.
It is possible to use this class for simulations where no hardware
robot exists.

It can communicate with a hardware robot using Bluetooth, WiFi, 
Ethernet, Serial, InfraRed, etc. using the abstracted connection
approach.

This class keeps track of the robots position, orientation, the path it
has traversed, physical dimensions, state, and the cell resolution
it is operating in.

It does not matter if the robot is a wheeled, tracked, bipod, etc. as 
long as the hardware conforms to the generic interface required by
the robonav tool.
